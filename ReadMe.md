# Spinning LED's
spinning leds... self explaining

If you want to use this code, please update the LED array if you dont start off with pin 13 and go up with pins on your arduino nano then. Also try to copy the WorkingCode file which is the best thing we currently can present you if you want to display and letters or other characters listen in the table font. Please try to add a stack overflow prehention in the "folge" array if you want to allow other people to create content and read any comments at the start of the file at least. We can't tell for sure that no errors are occuring, due to development.
